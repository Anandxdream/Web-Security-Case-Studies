## Overview
This lab demonstrates a reflected XSS vulnerability in the application's search feature.

## Vulnerability Type
Reflected XSS  
OWASP Top 10 2021 – A03: Injection

## Objective
Inject JavaScript into the response via user-controlled input.

## Testing Process

The search functionality reflected user input directly into the page response without proper encoding.

To confirm this behavior, I tested with a simple script payload.

## Payload Used

<script>alert(1)</script>

## Result

The script executed immediately when the search results page loaded.

This confirms that the application reflects input directly into the HTML response without sanitization.

## Impact

An attacker could:
- Steal session cookies
- Perform actions on behalf of users
- Deface content
- Deliver phishing payloads

## Root Cause

- Lack of output encoding
- No input filtering
- Direct reflection into HTML context

## Remediation

- Implement proper output encoding
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Validate and sanitize user input
